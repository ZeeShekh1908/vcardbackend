1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/SHETYGURU/VisitingCard_Geneartor_FireBase-Sql.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd  https://github.com/SHETYGURU/VisitingCard_Geneartor_FireBase-Sql.git
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up SQL Database**

   - Create an SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for the application.
   - Run any SQL scripts provided with the project (e.g., `schema.sql`) to set up the database tables.

5. **Configure Database Connection**

   - In the project directory, locate the configuration file (e.g., `.env` or `config.js`) where database settings are stored.
   - Add your SQL database connection details, such as `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_NAME`.

   Example for `.env` file:

   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=yourusername
   DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
   DB_NAME=yourdatabase
   DB_PORT=3306
   ```

6. **Configure Firebase (If Applicable)**

   - Set up Firebase in your Firebase Console and get your project configuration.
   - Update Firebase configuration in your app (usually in a `firebaseConfig.js` file).

7. **Run Database Migration (If Applicable)**

   Some projects require database migrations to create tables or set up initial data. Run the following command if your project uses migrations (e.g., with Sequelize):

   ```bash
   npx sequelize db:migrate
   ```

8. **Start the Node.js Server**

   Run the application server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command starts the server and connects it to the SQL database. If everything is configured correctly, you should see a message indicating that the server is running and connected to the database.

9. **Access the Application**

   Open a browser and go to:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

   This URL should display the application interface, allowing you to interact with it and utilize SQL storage.

### Database Management

- **Accessing the Database**: Use an SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin) to connect to your database, manage tables, and view data.
- **Environment Variables**: For security, keep sensitive database credentials in an `.env` file and ensure itâ€™s listed in `.gitignore` to prevent it from being pushed to version control.

### Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Issues**: Verify that your SQL server is running and the credentials in `.env` are correct.
- **Dependency Errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`.
- **Environment Variables**: Check that `.env` values are correctly loaded, and use `console.log(process.env.VARIABLE_NAME)` to debug.
